            <p>If you have been using a character that always wins and then suddenly you begin to lose matches it is not the character's fault neither is it your fault. My research has proven successful, 
                and my finding is that people who use a particular character for a long are people who blend with the character while other people who use characters and then suddenly start having problems
                 are not to blame the characters nor blame themselves but people with this type of problems tend to be more of a Pro player when using characters at random.
                I am counted as one of these people...normally if I use a character for too long, I start to have problems then, when I switch characters between matches, I surprisingly wing.
                So the advice for people with this problem is to stop using a specific character and move on to using different characters for different matches.</p>
