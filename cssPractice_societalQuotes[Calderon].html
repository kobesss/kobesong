       "Society as a whole benefits immeasurably from a climate in
       which all persons, regardless of race or gender, may have the
       opportunity to earn respect, responsibility, advancement and
       remuneration based on 
       <span class="strike-through">inheritance</span>
       ability."

     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor

        "Shall I not inform you of a better act than fasting, alms, and
         prayers? Making peace between one another: enmity and malice tear
         up heavenly rewards by the roots."
     <br><br>
     Prophet Muhammad
